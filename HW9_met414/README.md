For this assigment I worked closely with my groupmates: Matt Sloan, Kelsey Reid, Will Xia and Ozgur Akkas. 

For Task 1 we were able to identify 10-21-12 as the week in which subway rides dropped below 3 standard deviations from the mean. 

For Task 2 we were able to plot the rolling mean of rides by card type, we faced a challenge to then identify the card types which rose or fell in popularity over that period. 

For task 3 we were able to plot the Power Spectrum for rides by subway station over the 194 week period. But we faced a chalenge to then identify the 4 stations which illustrated the largest shift.
