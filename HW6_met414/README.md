# Assignment 1
## Linear Regression

For this assignemnt I worked very closely with my group mates Will Xia, Kelsey Reid, Matt Sloane, Ozgur Akkas.

In earlier Homeworks we had used the "! Curl O-"  method to download the data, however we were instructed to use the 'PUIDATA' environmental variable moving forward. An attempt to follow the skeleton notebook led us to issues with the environmental variable. After conferring with Professor Bianco we realized that PUIDATA existed as a file and not a folder. I deleted the file off Jupyter and created the folder using the mkdir bash command on the terminal. After this issue was resolved I was able to successfully download the data using the environmental variable. 

The collaboration within the group was critical to our ability to generate the plots and calculate the chi sq values. Closely following the skeleton notebook and consulting with our colleague Yao enabled us to pace through  the assignment while communicating via email and in person.
