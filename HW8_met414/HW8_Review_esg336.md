### Basic Components

 - The plot has most of the basic components. 
 - The title is clear, and it is overall easy to understand
 - The axis labels are clear
 - Issues:
      - The plot is missing a figure label and description
      - There are only 4 of 7 days of the week included
      - The y-axis label limit should be increased
      - The location of the felonies is not clear (Total in NYC?, NYS?, US?)

### Clarity
 - The plot is definitely straight forward, but there are some ambiguous variables
 - Takeaway: There are more felonies committed on Monday than Tues, Wed, or Thurs
 
### Esthetic
 - I think the plot is successful in illustrating that most felonies are committed on Mondays
 - If this plot were used in a presentation, it would need to be accompanied by a strong narrative  
 
### Honesty
 - The plot honestly portrays the trends in the data for the 4 days that are shown.
 
### Suggestion
 - In order to be an effective illustration, the plot should include the other 3 days of the week or explain why they are omitted. 
       - Omission wihtout explanation opens the door to many questions and much scrutiny
       - The first thing that came to mind is "What is Enrique trying to hide about Fri-Sun"

- Including the location of the felonies would make the plot clearer and more informative

- Reviewing this plot was quite enjoyable, thank you.
