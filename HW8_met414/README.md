# Plot Review
 - For this portion of the assigment I reviewed two of my colleagues plots. It indeed proved to be quite an enjoyable experience. 

# Assignment 1

For this portion of the assigment, I worked closely with my groupmates Will Xia, Matt Sloane, Kelsey Reid and Ozgur Akkas.
We began working on this assignment during the lab session of Julia Lane's guest lecture. We were able to download the data from the CUSP data facility. 

We were successfully able to wrangle it down to 59 community districts and assign ranks to each by total number of complaints.
