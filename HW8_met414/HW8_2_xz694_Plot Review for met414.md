### My Review:
1. Visual: The plot took too much space. It was difficult to see the complete plot without zooming out from the normal view. The oversized plot also makes the axis labels seem extra small. Ways to improve: Adjust the ranges of the axes. From 15 to 75 for X axis, and from 0.5 to 5 for Y axis, since no data points fall out of those ranges. Increasing the fontsize of the labels should also help.

2. Clarity: The label of the Y axis is confusing if looked at alone, without reading the notation. It will be clearer if simply leave it as Trip Duration and specfiy the unit as hour. Consider changing the steps of the axes or adding some grid lines, since when randomly pick a data point, it is a little difficult to tell their corresponding values.

3. Analysis: The conclusion mentioned in the caption is that the number of fines or fined trips decrease as the rider's age increases, with a linear regression line also shown in the plot. However, even if it is the result from running the regression, from the look of it, the trend does seem that evident or compelling. Maybe, we could have a better result with a histogram?
