# PUI 2016 HW 1 - Marc Toneatto

# Assignment 1 - Finishing Lab:
  Following the steps given on the class website, I was able to successfully resolve the git merge conflict. The history can be seen in the gittest2_met414 repository. 
  
# Assignment 2 - Setting Up the Environment:
  To create an Environmental Variable that led to the PUI2016_met414 directory, I opened the bash profile and entered the following command, as shown in the bash profile screenshot:
   export PUI2016=/home/cusp/met414/PUI2016_met414
   
  As shown in the command line screenshot, the PUI2016 environmental variable produced the desired outcome.
   
  To create an alias for the CUSP ssh, I followed a similar procedure. Using nano .bash_profile , I entered in the following command, as shown in the bash profile  screenshot:
  alias pui2016='cd $PUI2016'
  
  As shown in the command line screenshot, the pui2016  alias produced the desired outcome.
