#Assingnment 2

For this assignment, I worked independently. I began with an advanced search of PLOS One databases for 2 statistical analysis types. The studies I evaluated are below. 

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
MANOVA	| 1, diet| categorical | 3, Effect on Cerebral Metabolism, Cognition, Neuropathology| continuous| 1, mouse heredity | categorical| Extent to which 2 nutrient rich diets modulate Alzheimer Disease-related mechanisms in the brain| cognition test groups <= cognition control group | 0.05 | [Effects of Specific Multi-Nutrient Enriched Diets on Cerebral Metabolism, Cognition and Neuropathology in AbPPswe-PS1dE9 Mice](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075393) |

 # Assignment 3
 
 For this assignment, I worked closely with my group, which includes Kelsey Reid, Matt Sloane, Ozgur Akkas and Will Xia. We were developed the H1 and H0 hypotheses, ran the Z test and Chi square test. 
 
 # Assignment 4
 
 For this assignment, I worked with the same group. Going back to the Citibike data, we dowloanded the data as a zip file using !curl -O, then used pandas for wranglng. We dropped all columns but the Male and Female rider info, then graphed it by age in two separte charts.
