For this assignment, I worked independently. I began with an advanced search of PLOS One databases for 2 statistical analysis types. The studies I evaluated are below. 

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
MANOVA	| 1, diet| categorical | 3, Effect on Cerebral Metabolism, Cognition, Neuropathology| continuous| 1, mouse heredity | categorical)| Extent to which 2 nutrient rich diets modulate Alzheimer Disease-related mechanisms in the brain| cognition test groups <= cognition control group | 0.05 | [Effects of Specific Multi-Nutrient Enriched Diets on Cerebral Metabolism, Cognition and Neuropathology in AbPPswe-PS1dE9 Mice](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075393) |
Path Analysis	| 1, Health care knowledge| continuous | 3, Effect on healthy lifestyle (HLS), use of healthcare services (HCS) ,awareness of emerging health care concerns (HCC)| continuous| 1, a course on immunology | categorical| Determine wether taking a course in Immunology, which is expected to improve health care knowledge, actually had a postive influence on HLS, HCS and HCC| health care knowledge test groups <= control group | 0.05 | [Influence of Immunology Knowledge on Healthcare and Healthy Lifestyle](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159767) |
